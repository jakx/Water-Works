WATER WORKS FRAME

A plaform based on displaying to the user whatever fits into the good ol' MVC frame.

Start with editing RowDataModel to whatever you want to represent.

/models/ -> models go here
/pages/ -> pages go here
/controllers/ -> controllers go here, notable controllers include action and page
/templates/ -> templates go here
/views/ -> views go here
All Models, Views and Controllers should be named the same thing for example: example.php

/controllers/action.php -> where actions go
/controllers/page.php -> where new pages go

TO EDIT DATABASE:
sqlite3 db/example.sqlite
.schema

To create a new user:
http://example/create/user
